## 0.14.1

- Fixed minor bug in builder `SkipWhile1`
- Implemented constructor `ErrUnexpected.charOrEof(this.offset, String source, [int? c])`. Simplified (improved) the generated code of some parsers that parse characters and select the generated error depending on the position of parsing

## 0.14.0

- Breaking change: Changes have been made to the `State` class. The `opt` field has been removed. Instead, a `log` field has been added to indicate the need for error logging. This is an internal change that does not affect parser definitions

## 0.12.2

- Implemented experimental parser builder `TakeWhile1Fold`
- Improved character and string parser builders. The overall performance of the parsing process can be increased up to 3%
- Improved transformers (character predicates) `CharClass`, `NotCharClass` The overall performance of the parsing process can be increased up to 2%

## 0.12.1

- Changed helper function signature `fastBuild()`. Added named parameter `Map<String, Named> publish = const {}`. Example of specifying arguments: `publish: {'parse': _json}`. This will create the function `dynamic parse(String source)`. This makes it possible not to write public parsing functions by hand. The specified public parsing functions will be created automatically with the specified names and will be available for impossibility by users

## 0.12.0

- Breaking change: Transformers can now have multiple parameters. This allows them to be used as converter (mapper) functions with multiple parameters. An example of a typical use is use of them with the `Map2`, `Map3` (etc) parsers
- Implemented and tested parser builders `FoldMany0`
- Implemented and tested parser builders `Map2`, `Map3`, `Map4`, `Map5`, `Map6`, `Map7`
- Breaking change: The parser builder `Map$` has been renamed to `Map1`


## 0.11.0

- Breaking change: Transformers have become more powerful, much easier to use and clearer. And now they are full citizens, they have access to the building context and can allocate local variables and have access to global declarations. The number of methods has been reduced to two methods: `declare` (optional) and  `invoke`. This makes it possible to implement more efficient configurable (on startup) and context-sensitive parsers
- Improved generated source code of some character and string parsers. The overall performance of the parsing process can be increased up to 3%

## 0.10.2

- Improved character and string parser builders. Performance can be increased up to 5-7%
- Slightly improved the code generated by transformers `CharClass`, `NotCharClass` for small character ranges. The overall performance can be increased not less than 2% due to increasing performance of the frequently called critical parser functions that parse string data (character by character) in a loop using these transformers as predicates

## 0.10.1

- Fixed a bug in the transformer `NotCharClass` that could affect the work of parsers that are sensitive to parsing 32-bit characters, to which this transformer will be passed as a predicate. A rare case, but still a bug. The transformer `NotCharClass` now always returns `true` when calling its method `has32BitChars`

## 0.10.0

- Breaking change: Another round of improvements. Now it's time to improve transformers. Transformers now allow you to solve different problems. Transformers now have three main features: `declare`, `inline` and `invoke`. Each transformer must support the `declare` and `invoke` capability. Support for `inline` is optional, but it's the support for this feature that makes them very performant (and parsers too). The most requested transformers are already available, but nothing prevents you from creating your own transformer with the necessary functionality. All parser builders have already been updated to use the new transformers, which increases performance by at least 10% and makes the source  code a little smaller
- Removed all existing transformers
- Added transformers `ClosureTransformer`, `ExprTransformer`, `FuncExprTransformer`, `FuncTransformer`, `VarTransformer`

## 0.9.2

- Breaking change: The parser builder `Skip` has been renamed to `Sequence`
- Breaking change: The parser builder `SkipMany0` has been removed so as not to make modifications with minor differences. Instead, it is recommended to use the following combination of parsers `Many0Count(Sequence(p1, p2, etc))`

## 0.9.1

- Minor changes in the parser builders

## 0.9.0

- Introduced a new feature called `optional` mode. Does not make breaking changes. Operates automatically. Principle of operation (briefly): tells parsers not to generate errors in `optional` mode because errors are not used (ignored) in this mode. Benefits: significant reduction in memory usage, 5-10% increase in performance

## 0.8.2

- Documented and tested parser builder `EscapeSequence`
- Minor improvements in the `Number` parser. Now the generated parser parses even a little faster. The parser is currently only used internally, when generating a `JSON` parser example

## 0.8.1

- Improved most string parser builders. The generated code is fast again
- Minor improvements in parser builders `Alpha0`, `Alpha1`, `Alphanumeric0`, `Alphanumeric1`, `Digit0`, `Digit1`, `HexDigit0`, `HexDigit1`
- Removed parser builders `Crlf`, `LineEnding` in favor of using parser builder `Tags` which generates code more efficiently than the original code for these removed builders

## 0.8.0

- Breaking change: String parser builders have been revert back. The reason is that Dart is completely unpredictable in terms of predicting performance when writing code. Performance can be reduced by 20% with just a few changes to the source code. Dart is not C/C++, what should be fast in C/C++ will not necessarily be fast in Dart

## 0.7.2

- Minor changes in the parser builders
- Slightly improved generated code (for short tags) by parser builders `NoneOfTags`, `Tags`. Now tags can be specified in any order, the parsing will be done correctly in every case

## 0.7.1

- Fixed bugs in parser builders that generate parsers use other parsers and, at the same time, restore the parsing state. Generated parsers did not restore the value of the newly introduced field of the current character `state.ch`. These builders include `Not`, `Peek`
- Slightly improved generated code by parser builders `NoneOf`, `OneOf`. The generated parser code has become a little faster and a little smaller in size

## 0.7.0

- Breaking change: String parser builders have been reimplemented to use methods `state.getChar()`, `state.nextChar()`, `state.readChar()` and field `state.ch`. The methods are implemented as static extension methods for the `State<String>` class. This change generates a more readable parser source code and reduces its size by 10% and may slightly reduce parser performance by 5-10%.

## 0.6.0

- Breaking change: Unified declaration and usage of the `Transformer`. The transformer code must be a function body or a `callable` object. If the code is the body of a function, then the function will be declared, otherwise the variable will be declared. In both cases, the generated code must be used as a function call.
- Breaking change:  Removed `bool search` parameter from class `CharClass`, added `RangeProcessing processing` parameter

- Added a script `fast_build.dart` with a function `fastBuild` to simplify build process
- Implemented and tested parser builders `Alphanumeric0`, `Alphanumeric1`, `AnyChar`, `HexDigit0`, `HexDigit1`

## 0.2.1-3.dev

- Implemented and tested parser builders `SkipWhile1`
- Added support for an unofficial way to display error messages (for development purposes) via the `getErrorMessageProcessor` function
- Breaking change: Removed all building methods from context class `Context`
- - Added class `ParseRuntime` with source codes of static  declarations necessary for the runtime of the generated parsers

## 0.2.1-2.dev

- Implemented and tested parser builders `Alpha0`, `Alpha1`, `Digit0`, `Digit1`, `NoneOfTags`, `TakeWhile1`
- A new method `BuildBodyEx` has been introduced, which is currently the basis for building the parser body from a template
- Renamed parser builder `SkipWhile0` to `SkipWhile`
- Breaking change: The parser builders `TakeWhile`, `TakeWhileMN` now return a parsed string instead of a character list. It was a mistake to implement them to return a list

## 0.2.1-1.dev

- Implemented and tested parser builders `Consumed`, `Not`, `Peek`, `Recognize`, `Tags`, `Tuple2`, `Tuple3`, `Tuple4`, `Tuple5`, `Tuple6`, `Tuple7`
- Changed parser builder `Eof` from `Eof extends ParserBuilder<String, dynamic>` to `Eof<I> extends ParserBuilder<I, dynamic>`. Now it can be used not only with `String` data

## 0.2.0
